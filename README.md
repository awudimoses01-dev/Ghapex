# GHApex — Static landing page (local copy)

This repository is a lightweight static recreation of a GHApex landing page for local testing and demonstration.

Files
- `index.html` — Main static page
- `css/styles.css` — Styles
- `js/main.js` — Small interactive bits (smooth-scroll, contact form validation)
- `thank-you.html` — Redirect target after a successful contact form submission
- `admin.html`, `customer-dashboard.html`, `driver-dashboard.html` — Static dashboard mockups

Contact form
- The contact form in `index.html` is wired to FormSubmit (https://formsubmit.co) and posts to `info@ghapex.com` by default. It disables FormSubmit's captcha and redirects to `thank-you.html` on success. Update the `action` attribute on the form if you want form submissions to go to a different email.

GitHub Pages
- The workflow at `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` publishes this repository to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main` (it uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` to publish the repository root to the `gh-pages` branch).

Run locally
- Open `index.html` in your browser, or start a simple static server (requires Node):

```powershell
npx http-server . -c-1
```

Notes
- The repository no longer contains any downloader scripts for external sites. All images included are part of the project tree (or have been removed if you requested cleanup).
- Dashboards are static mockups with no backend. I can convert them to a client app or wire them up to an API if you want.

If you want me to also remove these files from the git history entirely (they would be purged from past commits), I can prepare a safe plan using `git filter-repo` or the BFG Repo-Cleaner — this requires a force-push and explicit approval.
